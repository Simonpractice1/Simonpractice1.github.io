We study a reform in Germany that abruptly abolished this mandate for stock corporations incorporated after August 1994, while it locked the mandate for the slightly older cohorts. Our research design compares firm cohorts incorporated before the reform and after; in a robustness check we draw on the analogous difference in unaffected firm types (LLCs). We find no effects of board-level codetermination on wages and the wage structure, even in firms with particularly flexible wages. The degree of rent sharing and the labor share are also unaffected. We reject that disinvestment could have offset wage effects through the canonical hold-up channel, as shared governance, if anything, increases capital formation.

The value of nonemployment is therefore a key determinant of wages. We measure the wage effect of changes in the value of nonemployment among initially employed workers. Our quasi-experimental variation in the value of nonemployment arises from four large reforms of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. We document that wages are insensitive to UI benefit changes: point estimates imply a wage response of less than $0.01 per $1.00 UI benefit increase, and we can reject sensitivities larger than $0.03. The insensitivity holds even among workers with low wages and high predicted unemployment duration, and among job switchers hired out of unemployment. The insensitivity of wages to the nonemployment value presents a puzzle to the widely used Nash bargaining model, which predicts a sensitivity of $0.24–$0.48. Our evidence supports wage-setting models that insulate wages from the value of nonemployment.","tags":null,"title":"Wages and the Value of Nonemployment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Jaeger","Jorg Heining"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b34ddeeca183cd3b36ea4c7e0e2df271","permalink":"https://simonpractice1.github.io/publication/jh_2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jh_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"To assess the substitutability between workers within a firm, and between incumbent workers and outsiders, we estimate how exogenous worker exits aaa","tags":null,"title":"How Substitutable are Workers?

Individuals assigned to the treatment group of our experiment received a brochure that informed them about job search strategies and the consequences of unemployment, and motivated them to actively look for new employment. We study the causal impact of the brochure by comparing labor market outcomes of treated and untreated job seekers in administrative data containing comprehensive information on individuals’ employment status and earnings. The effects of our treatment tend to be positive, but concentrated among job seekers who are at risk of being unemployed for an extended period of time. Specifically, treatment effects in our overall sample are moderately positive on average but mostly insignificant. At the same time, we do observe pronounced and statistically significant effects for individuals who exhibit an increased risk of long-term unemployment. For this group, the brochure increases employment and earnings in the year after the intervention by roughly 4%. Given the low cost of the intervention, our findings indicate that targeted information provision can be a highly effective policy tool in the labor market.","tags":null,"title":"Learning about Job Search: A Field Experiment with Job Seekers in Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Jaeger","Peter Ganong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528675200,"objectID":"e7b8ceb9ca7888c6d93f074137dfd7a1","permalink":"https://simonpractice1.github.io/publication/jg_2018/","publishdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jg_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The regression kink (RK) design is an increasingly popular empirical method for estimating causal effects of policies, such as the effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment duration. Using simulation studies based on data from existing RK designs, we empirically document that the statistical significance of RK estimators based on conventional standard errors can be spurious. In the simulations, false positives arise as a consequence of nonlinearities in the underlying relationship between the outcome and the assignment variable, confirming concerns about the misspecification bias of discontinuity estimators pointed out by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik. As a complement to standard RK inference, we propose that researchers construct a distribution of placebo estimates in regions with and without a policy kink and use this distribution to gauge statistical significance. Under the assumption that the location of the kink point is random, this permutation test has exact size in finite samples for testing a sharp null hypothesis of no effect of the policy on the outcome. We implement simulation studies based on existing RK applications that estimate the effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment duration and show that our permutation test as well as inference procedures proposed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik improve upon the size of standard approaches, while having sufficient power to detect an effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment duration.","tags":null,"title":"A Permutation Test for the Regression Kink Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Jaeger","Johannes Abeler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438387200,"objectID":"23d84c38a68537513f7c8c8b52145915","permalink":"https://simonpractice1.github.io/publication/ja_2015/","publishdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ja_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"How does complexity affect people's reaction to tax changes?
